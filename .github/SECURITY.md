# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability:
To report a vulnerability or security issue, please directly contact me via [Email](mailto:sven.fehler@web.de) or [a Discord private message](https://discordapp.com/users/415597358752071693)  
Please **do not** create a GitHub issue!

## Supported Versions:
This library is deprecated. There will not be any updates anymore except maybe for some really necessary security patches.  
Please use https://github.com/Sv443/SvCoreLib now, it has all the old source code and will continue to get new features.  

<!--
Only the latest minor version is supported and will be receiving security updates  
For example, if the current version is v1.12.5, all versions from v1.12.0 up to v1.12.5 will receive security updates  
In case a security vulnerability was found and is patched, a new patch will be released. In the above example that would be v1.12.6  
NPM should update JSLib once a new patch is released. If not, simply use the command `npm update`
-->
