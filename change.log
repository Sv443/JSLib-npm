[1.6.5]:
    - changed dependency "perf_hooks" to "execution-time" because a feature was deprecated
    - completely deprecated the all-lowercase alias "jsl.isempty()" of the function "jsl.isEmpty()"
    - cleaned up the code a bit

[1.6.6]:
    - removed "jsl.settings" completely
    - updated documentation for "jsl.ping()"

[1.7.0]:
    - fixed typo in "readme.md"
    - added "ProgressBar" class to create a dynamic progress bar
    - added function "jsl.readdirRecursive(folder, callback(err, result){})" to read a folder and its subfolders asynchronously
    - added function "jsl.readdirRecursiveSync(folder)" to read a folder and its subfolders synchronously
    - added function "jsl.readableArray(array, separators, lastSeparator)" to make an array more easily human-readable
    - split the package up into three separate files
    - removed all dependencies because they are either included by default or their effect was easily recreatable in vanilla JS

> [1.8.0]:
    - new features:
        - function "jsl.generateSeededNumbers(count, seed)" to generate "random" numbers based on a passed seed
        - function "jsl.generateRandomSeed(digitCount)" to generate a random seed to be used in "jsl.generateSeededNumbers()"
        - function "jsl.validateSeed(seed)" to check whether or not a seed is valid
        - function "jsl.mapRange(value, range_1_min, range_1_max, range_2_min, range_2_max)" to transform a value from one numerical range to another
        - function "jsl.downloadFile(url, destPath, options)" to download a file from a URL
        - function "jsl.unused(any_var)" to indicate an unused variable to a linter
        - function "jsl.replaceAt(input: str, index: number, replacement: str)" to replace a character inside a string with a replacement string
        - object "colors" to make it easier to add colors to the console output - this will replace "jsl.consoleColor()"
        - class "MenuPrompt" for an interactive menu (directly in the CLI) - methods:
            - TODO: "open()" to open the prompt
            - TODO: "addMenu()" to add a new menu to the prompt
            - "validateMenu()" to check whether a menu is invalid
            - "currentMenu()" to get the current menu index
            - "close()" to close the prompt
            - "result()" to prematurely get the results of the prompt
    - improvements / fixes:
        - put all random number generator related stuff in a separate file ("rng.js")
        - improved time measurement system for "jsl.ping()"
        - improved the background stuff in "jsl.ping()" to improve performance
        - added "contentType" property to "jsl.ping()"'s promise callback
        - edited a bunch of functions and methods to throw an error instead of returning it as a string, which could've caused unwanted and unpredictable behavior
        - put the UUID generation inside an object, renamed it and added three new ones:
            - "generateUUID.hexadecimal(format: str, upperCase: bool)" [0-9,a-f/A-F]
            - "generateUUID.alphanumerical(format: str, upperCase: bool)" [0-9,a-z/A-Z]
            - "generateUUID.decimal(format: str)" [0-9]
            - "generateUUID.binary(format: str)" [0-1]
            - "generateUUID.custom(format: str, possibleValues: str)" [Custom]
        - added "contributors" property to the "jsl.info" object
        - removed the signal "SIGKILL" from the shutdown prevention functions as SIGKILL is intended as a signal that forces a process to be exited no matter what
